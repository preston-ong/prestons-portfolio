### Summary

Tutors spend on average 10 minutes preparing student progress reports for parents for every two hours of class. In order to help tutors save time on preparing reports manually, I was recruited as the Product Manager at an EdTech startup to help tutors streamline their reporting process.

After conducting 30+ user interviews with tutors and parents and negotiating expectations with stakeholders, I developed a list of user stories alongside low-fidelity wireframes and requirements. The following six months were spent executing the product backlog with a team of 3 engineers on bi-weekly sprints.

The smart reporting feature was launched for 50+ tutors, which has helped tutors reduce the time spent on preparing reports per two hours of class by 80% from 10 minutes to two minutes, estimated based on tutorsâ€™ self-report.
