### Summary

The prolonged period of remote learning has caused significant learning loss to students, intensifying the need for revision worksheets amongst students for self-learning.

Recognizing this need, I started compiling worksheets (past papers, notes) for high-school students and uploaded the files onto the Board website I have built.

### Tech Stack

Laravel, Javascript/jQuery, SaSS, Bootstrap 4, AWS S3, MySQL, Stripe
