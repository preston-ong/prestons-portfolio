### Summary

Driven to make a social impact to reduce education inequality in Malaysia, I volunteered with ProjectEd Malaysia, a student-led non-profit organization to provide scholarships to talented scholars from underprivileged backgrounds to attend university under the Knowledge is Free (KIF) scholarship program.

I contributed to the organisation by managing a Tech Team of 3 to maintain and update ProjectEd's website.
