### Summary

A personal problem I had during high school constantly seeking homework help prompted me to build an online forum to connect students to qualified mentors to seek academic help.

I hacked the website and recruited a team of mentors consisting of teachers and university students in a month. The website was well-received by students, gaining 100+ signups on the first day of launch. Riding on the early traction, I reached out to friends to help grow the website, and a team of 8 was established.

We managed to 10x the monthly active users (MAU) with various growth strategies in the span of 12 months.
