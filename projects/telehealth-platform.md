### Summary

Carepool Asia is a digital health platform offering multidisciplinary health consultations to enterprises. I was recruited during the startup ideation phase as the first engineer to develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

As the team was lean, I had to wear many hats spanning from UI/UX design, full-stack web development and quality assurance. The MVP was launched with great success, attracting 200+ signups on the first day of launch.

As the team scaled, I led a team of two engineers and one designer to execute monthly sprints, with 94% (16/17) sprints delivered on time within the defined scope.

### Tech Stack

jQuery, SaSS, Bootstrap 4, Laravel, MySQL, Stripe
