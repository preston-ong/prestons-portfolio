### Summary

As my final-year project, working with a group of 3, we developed an RNN-LSTM model that is trained on the NSL-KDD dataset with a final evaluation accuracy of ~78%. A React-based dashboard is developed to display any anomaly detection to the system administrators of the
network in monitor.

### Tech Stack

Tensorflow, Python, ReactJS
